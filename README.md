# Danny's Module
A private module for Foundry VTT

* contains scenes, macros, actors, etc.
* Meant to be portable from world to world and from foundry installation to foundry installation
* Is maintained on github, using Danny's desktop as a master for pushing repository updates.

## Notes on publishing updates
* Make sure all commits follow conventional commit format (use fix: or feat: as prefix to all commit messages).
* After committing and pushing to github, create a release on github and assign a new release tag
* Tags for this repository are the format "v1.0.5", for example.
* The workflow actions should run automatically when the release is published.  Check whether it succeeded or not in the Actions tab on Github.
